###### Prism Selection algorithm properties 
#
# PRISSMA search algorithm Matching threshold [0,1]
# 0 = perfect match
threshold = .6
#
# Cost of missing RDF entity  [0,1]
missing_ctxunit_entity_cost= 1
#
# Cost of missing RDF string literal  [0,1]
missing_ctxunit_string_cost= 1

# Decay constant for substitution edit operation on time
decay_constant_time = 10
#
# Decay constant for substitution edit operation on location
decay_constant_geo = 5
#
# String similarity measure.
# Supported measures:
#   - Edit distance based: JARO, JARO_WINKLER, MONGE_ELKAN, LEVENSTHEIN
#   - Semantic string similarities: LIN, WUPALMER, PATH
